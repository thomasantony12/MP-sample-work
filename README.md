# Documentation for ToDo App

## Introduction

This ToDo App is a task management application designed for the Mallu Programmers Community to help test my skills. It allows users to efficiently add, delete, edit, and manage tasks. User can toggle task statuses, filter tasks based on their current status, and perform bulk deletions.

## Features

1. Add New Task

   - Users can create new tasks by entering a title and optional description.

2. Delete Task

   - Individual tasks can be deleted by clicking on the delete button.

3. Edit Task

   - Users can modify the title or description of a task.

4. Toggle Task Status

   - Tasks can be marked as Completed or toggled back to Active.
   - The status updates visually to indicate completion.

5. View Tasks by Status

   - Filter tasks to view only Active or Completed tasks.
   - All tasks can also be displayed without filtering.

6. Bulk Delete Tasks

   - Users can select multiple tasks and delete them simultaneously.

## Technologies Used
