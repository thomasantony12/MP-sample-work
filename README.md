# Documentation for ToDo App

## Introduction

This ToDo App is a task management application designed for the Mallu Programmers Community to help test my skills. It allows user to add, delete, edit, and manage tasks efficiently. User can toggle task statuses, filter tasks based on their current status, and perform bulk deletions.

## Features

1. Add New Task

Users can create new tasks by entering a title and optional description.

2. Delete Task

Individual tasks can be deleted by clicking on the delete button.

3. Edit Task

Users can modify the title or description of a task.

4. Toggle Task Status

Tasks can be marked as Completed or toggled back to Active.
The status updates visually to indicate completion.

5. View Tasks by Status

Filter tasks to view only Active or Completed tasks.
All tasks can also be displayed without filtering.

6. Bulk Delete Tasks

Users can select multiple tasks and delete them simultaneously.

   PostgreSQL: Database for storing tasks.

2. Frontend:
